## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/jkirchartz/pos2tracery/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/jkirchartz/pos2tracery/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* open a pull request.
* start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work; but then open a pull request anyway.
